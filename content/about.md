I’m Sophie, a writer.

I’ve been a senior writer at ClickHole and a marketing writing lead at Cash App, where I wrote scripts for namedroppy names like Megan Thee Stallion, Desus and Mero, and the Pod Save America guys. I was in their minds and brains.

I’ve published cartoons in the New Yorker, jokes in The Onion, and articles on Gawker. I’ve written for games like Cards Against Humanity and Monikers, and collaborated on creative development with their designers.

A “fun fact” about me is that I was never a baby. I skipped that.
